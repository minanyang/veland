# grant anything that can destroy work, force-push, bypass branch protection or run arbitrary code.
# Creating an issue and posting a comment are public writes: never granted, so they always prompt.
# open, work and roadmap must load the shared references/grill.md (beside the skills directory) through a granted `veland-grill`.
# The grill must always ask a ticket's own open questions, and work must post their answers through comment.md.
# The skills and review agents that report on work must carry the verify-first rule.
# work and close must resolve .veland/<id>/ paths against the printed `ticket dir:` and take the base from `base:`.
# work's Step 0 must map a typed gh-<n> to its id and read an approved plan before any ticket text is fetched; close must
# name the valid tickets values when check refuses one.
# work must grant veland-test and run tests only through it, editing only with Edit and Write.
# work must lock the tests half before the implementation half, and send a relock to a fresh code-reviewer.
# open, work, close, batch and roadmap must each have a `## Replies` section.
