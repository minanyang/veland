# End-to-end scenarios

`run.sh` drives `/veland:open`, `/veland:work`, `/veland:close`, `/veland:batch` and `/veland:roadmap` through real `claude -p` runs against throwaway repos,
a github.com origin backed by a local bare repo, and a fake `gh`. Each scenario passes or fails on state alone: files
under `.veland/`, git state (main checkout, worktree, branches), origin's heads, the fake `gh` call log, and the tool
calls of the stream-json log (tool name, Bash command, `subagent_type`, `run_in_background`) — never the model's text.

## Run

```bash
bash tests/e2e/run.sh              # all 41 scenarios
bash tests/e2e/run.sh 7 O2 C3      # only these (ids are case-sensitive; an unknown id exits 2 before any claude run)
```

It prints one line per scenario, in the order 1–14, O1–O3, F1–F2, W1–W8, C1–C3, B1–B6, R1–R5, then `total <seconds>s`:

```
pass  7  41s
FAIL  11  38s  gh pr merge got no --match-head-commit equal to the worktree's HEAD
total 412s
```

The number is the seconds of the scenario's flow (scenarios of one flow share its runs). The exit code is 1 when any
scenario fails and 2 for an unknown id or a missing prerequisite. The summed cost of the runs goes to stderr. A flow
that fails keeps its directories, and the runner says where: `origin.git/`, `repo/`, `gh/` (the fake's `canned.json`,
`state.json`, `calls.log`) and `log/` (one stream-json file per turn).

## Prerequisites

- A logged-in `claude` on PATH. **Every run calls the model (`--model sonnet`) and costs tokens**; it is in no gate and
  not in CI.
- `jq`, `node`, and `git` 2.38 or newer (`merge-tree --write-tree`). The runner checks them before the first flow.
- bash 3.2 or newer.

## Time and cost of one full run

About 15 minutes and $9: `total 872s` and `cost $9.00` (the sum of the stream-json `result` lines'
`total_cost_usd`) for all 27 scenarios on 2026-10-18 with `--model sonnet`. Six failed in that run, from two causes the
model has to find out by itself because no command prints the answer:

- 8, 10, 12, C1, C3 — close looked for `.veland/gh-5/review.md` in the worktree instead of the main checkout, found
  nothing and stopped, so the branch was not landed in time.
- O1 — open drafted the issue before looking at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, so the first draft had no `Form:` line
  (`veland-land issue` refused it, and the next turn fixed it).

## How it is set up

- **Flows, not one run per scenario.** A flow is one sequence of turns on one fixture; each scenario is an assertion
  bound to a flow and a checkpoint (`bindings` in `scenarios.sh`). Naming scenarios runs only the flows they need, up
  to the last checkpoint needed. Skills that grill the user are answered with `go with your recommendations` until
  the checkpoint state exists (a draft, `plan.md`, the memory commit, a PR), at most 6 turns per checkpoint.
- **The batch flow** (`batch-two`, B1–B6) types `/veland:batch gh-5 gh-6` with `batch.parallel: 2` and `close: local`. The
  workers `veland-batch` starts are `$RUN/claude-worker`, named by `VELAND_BATCH_CLAUDE`: the same `claude` with the flags
  of the other flows. The conductor is answered with `go with your recommendations; approve every plan that can be
  approved` (at most 8 turns) until `veland-batch status` says `done`. Its scenarios read the conductor's tool log and the
  workers' `.veland/_batch/<id>/runs.tsv`; B3 checks the files rule against the plans the run produced.
- **The roadmap flows.** `roadmap-files` (no origin, so `tickets: files`) types `/veland:roadmap <requirements>` and
  approves the draft (R1: no `roadmap.md` before the approval, its shape and `git status` after), merges more
  requirements (R2: every line of the first file still there), shows it with no arguments (R3: nothing written), then
  types `/veland:roadmap tickets <first version>` and approves (R4: one ticket file per item, linked into the row), each
  typed command in its own session. `roadmap-gh` starts from a prepared `roadmap.md` with one version of two items and
  runs `tickets v1` against the fake `gh` (R5: two issues, their `gh-<n>` linked into the row).
- **`work-approved`** (W8) starts from an approved `plan.md` and `ticket.md` for gh-5 and no worktree (`prep_plan`), as an
  earlier session leaves them, and types `/veland:work gh-5` once in a new session: Step 0 must go to the worktree
  without fetching the ticket or grilling again.
- **Close flows start from prepared state** (`prep_ticket`): the worktree, a committed fix, `ticket.md`, an approved
  `plan.md`, `review.md` and `evidence.md` — `/veland:work` is not run.
- **Fake `gh`** (`bin/gh`) answers from `canned.json` and `state.json`, logs every call's argv to `calls.log`, and
  squash-merges into the bare origin on `pr merge`. **Fake `ssh`** (`bin/ssh`) is `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`: it runs
  `git-upload-pack` / `git-receive-pack` on the bare origin for `git@github.com:test/fixture.git`.
- **No real `gh`.** Every PATH directory holding a `gh` is replaced by a shadow directory of symlinks to its other
  executables; the runner runs with an empty `GH_CONFIG_DIR` and without `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
  `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`. A flow with the fake also fails when its tool log has more executed `gh <sub> <sub2>`
  commands than the fake's call log has entries.
- **Permissions.** `claude -p` runs with `--permission-mode acceptEdits`, never `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (a batch
  worker's plan session: `default`, with writes allowed under `.veland/` only). A
  `permission_denials` entry in the stream-json `result` in the skills' scope — any tool but Bash, a `veland-`, `gh`
  or `glab` command, or one a skill's `allowed-tools` or the runner's grants cover — fails every scenario of the flow
  and names the command. Any other denial is the model's own look around (`git -C … log`, running a repo script, or a
  command it chained with `|`, `;` or `&&`, which the skills never run): it is printed on stderr as
  `note: <flow> denied (not the skill's): <command>` and fails nothing. What
  the skills leave to the user is granted to these throwaway runs with `--settings` (an untrusted workspace ignores
  `.claude/settings.json`): `git -C * add *`, `git -C * commit *`, `veland-land issue *`, `veland-land comment *`. They
  are the harness's grants, not rules to copy into your own settings: `git -C * commit *` can also match
  `git -C <dir> -c core.hooksPath=<dir> commit`, which runs any code.
- **The plugin under test** is `VELAND_E2E_PLUGIN` (default: this repo). It is passed as `--plugin-dir`, its `bin/` comes
  right after the fake `gh` on PATH, every PATH entry containing `/.claude/plugins/` is dropped, and a flow fails before
  calling `claude` when `command -v veland-land` does not resolve into that `bin/`.

## Showing a scenario can fail

Run a scenario against a copy of the plugin with one edit; it must print `FAIL`:

```bash
copy="$(mktemp -d)" && cp -R . "$copy/veland"
# 1. veland-land merge without the pin: edit "$copy/veland/bin/veland-land", delete `--match-head-commit "$(git -C "$path" rev-parse HEAD)"`
VELAND_E2E_PLUGIN="$copy/veland" bash tests/e2e/run.sh 11
# 2. close without the blocker check: edit "$copy/veland/skills/close/SKILL.md", delete the last bullet of Step 0
VELAND_E2E_PLUGIN="$copy/veland" bash tests/e2e/run.sh 14
# 3. close's grants lost after the background wait: edit "$copy/veland/hooks/hooks.json", delete both `hooks/grant.js` entries
VELAND_E2E_PLUGIN="$copy/veland" bash tests/e2e/run.sh C3
```

## The runner's own test

`bash tests/e2e-runner.test.sh` checks the runner offline with a stub `claude` (`VELAND_E2E_CLAUDE`): a denial in the
skills' scope is reported with its command and one outside it is only a note, a tool-log `gh` call missing from the
fake's log fails the flow, an unknown id exits 2, and a failing scenario makes the exit code non-zero. It is in the
gates.
