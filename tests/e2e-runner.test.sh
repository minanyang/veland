# Cases: unknown ids exit 2 before any claude run; a permission denial in the skills' scope is reported with its
# command, and one outside it is a note on stderr that fails nothing; a gh call in the
# tool log that the fake never saw fails the flow; a plugin without bin/veland-land fails before claude runs; a
# failing scenario makes the exit code non-zero; a failure after a checkpoint keeps the results judged at it; W3
# counts a plan.md written by a Bash redirect; the fake gh answers a call with gh's global --hostname; a denied command
# chained with |, ; or && is a note.
