# cutter guard — PreToolUse hook for Bash that blocks destructive commands.
# Registered by the plugin's hooks/hooks.json with matcher "Bash".
#
# Receives the Claude Code hook JSON on stdin; the bash command is at
# `.tool_input.command`.
#
#   exit 0  → allow the command
#   exit 2  → block the command and surface the stderr message to Claude
#
# Best-effort, not a sandbox: it matches command text, so an indirect form
# (a script, an alias, eval) gets past it.
#
# To run a blocked command anyway, run it yourself in chat with the
# `!<command>` prefix.
