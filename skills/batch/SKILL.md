# Conduct a batch of tickets

`/veland:batch <tickets>` works through many tickets from this terminal. You relay: `veland-batch` schedules, records and lands the tickets, each in its own background `claude -p` worker, and you carry the workers' turns to the user and the user's answers back.

Run one command per Bash call — no `&&`, `;` or `|` — so each call matches this skill's `allowed-tools` on its own.

## Step 0 — Start or resume

With arguments (`gh-<n>`, `<n>`, `#<n>`, an issue URL, existing ticket ids, `--search "<query>"`), run:

```bash
veland-batch init <args>
```

With none, run `veland-batch status`. An exit 2 from either is a stop: quote its `veland-batch:` line and ask the user how to go on.

## Step 1 — Act on `status`

```bash
veland-batch status
```

`status` prints the board, then the actions allowed now, one per line: `plan <id>`, `implement <id>`, `close <id>`, `answer <id>` (` approvable` appended when `approve` is allowed), and `done`.

Start every `plan`, `implement` and `close` action as `veland-batch run <id> <kind>` with `run_in_background` and `timeout: 7200000`, all the actions of one `status` in one message, then end your turn. When a run wakes you, run `veland-batch status` again.

A refused `veland-batch run` (a permission or the schedule) is reported to the user as it was printed. Never work around it, and never retry it differently.

## Step 2 — Rounds of answers

When `status` lists `answer` lines, Read each such ticket's `.veland/_batch/<id>/turn.md` and show them all, grouped by ticket, in one message. For an `approvable` one, also Read `.veland/<id>/plan.md` and show it verbatim after its turn, under its path, and tell the user they can open that file themselves before approving: the user approves the plan, not the worker's account of it. Give the choices per ticket: answers to its questions, or, for an `approvable` one, `approve`, `revise <notes>` and `drop`. Wait for the reply; it may cover several tickets.

Write each ticket's reply to `.veland/_batch/<id>/reply.md`, then start `veland-batch run <id> reply` in the background (same flags as Step 1):

- answers: the user's words for that ticket, verbatim.
- `approve`: run `veland-land comment <id>` first when `.veland/<id>/comment.md` exists (left to the user's permissions), then `veland-batch approve <id>`, which records the approval and writes the reply itself. It is not in this skill's `allowed-tools` on purpose: each approve asks the user's permission, naming the ticket, so text a worker wrote can never approve a plan. Only the user's `approve` for that ticket starts it.
- `revise <notes>`: write "Revise the plan: <notes>". Show its next turn on its own, not in a round.
- `drop`: run `veland-batch drop <id>`.

## Step 3 — Done

On `done`, end with the board.

## Replies

- Lead with the result. No first sentence that announces what comes next, and no closing recap or offer.
- Between routine tool calls, at most one line per phase change — a phase is one of this skill's numbered steps.
- Say each fact once: what the reply has already shown is not summarised again.

Some things are exempt from these rules and are written in full: a security warning; a question to the user; a worker's turn shown to the user; and anything persisted, such as `reply.md`.

The final reply is the board.

## Never

- Never run `/veland:work` or `/veland:close` yourself, and never edit anything but `.veland/_batch/<id>/reply.md`.
- Never run `veland-batch approve` for a ticket the user did not approve in their own words.
- Never use `CronCreate`, `ScheduleWakeup` or `/loop`; background runs wake you.
- Never reply that something is unverified, unchecked or not yet confirmed: check it first. Only when a check is impossible, say so, naming what was tried and why it cannot be checked.
